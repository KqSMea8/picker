<div class="etf-aim-full-text">The aim is for your investment to
reflect the performance of the iTraxx{{®}} Crossover 5-year TOTAL
RETURN INDEX (Index). The risk that a borrower fails to perform its
payment obligations is known as credit risk. A person may obtain
protection against credit risk by entering into a financial
contract to pass on this risk to a credit protection seller (credit
derivative transaction) subject to certain credit events. The Index
measures the return for a credit protection seller holding the most
current issue of the iTraxx{{®}} Crossover credit derivative
transaction with a term of 5 years. The performance of the Index
will depend on several factors including the market value of 5-year
iTraxx{{®}} Crossover credit derivative transactions, returns
generated by selling credit protection in respect of the issuers
included in the Index and losses paid following defaults by those
issuers. The Index is comprised of up to 50 European companies with
credit ratings of below investment grade and is calculated on a
total return basis meaning that any balance that remains after
acquiring the credit exposure will earn interest at the rate at
which banks in the Eurozone lend to each other on an overnight
basis (as calculated by the European Central Bank). The Index is
published by the Markit Indices Limited. Certain costs may be
deducted from the Index. To achieve the aim, the Fund will buy
tradable debt (bonds) and/or invest in cash deposits and enter into
derivatives with Deutsche Bank relating to the bonds/deposits and
the Index, in order to obtain the return on the Index. No dividends
will be paid on your shares. You may redeem your investment on
demand on a daily basis.</div>
